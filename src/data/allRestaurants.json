We have been operating as a to-go option only through the fine dining restaurant. Our guests have been so happy to have this option and demand has been so high that we decided to renovate a building just below the restaurant and plan to expand on the bakery sandwiches by introducing an additional full menu of plant based options. We hope to have the renovation completed soon, but until then we will continue the take out through the Foothills Milling Co restaurant.",

Premium toppings such as grilled chicken, pulled pork, guacamole, salsa, queso, buffalo or bbq sauce make for a Premium Petro's Experience. The menu rounds out with giant baked potatoes, black angus all-beef hot dogs, nachos and wedge salads, all made to order to your specifications. Last, but certainly not least, is the refreshing Hint-of-Orange Iced Tea (not flavored, but infused with orange essential oils and brewed with dried orange rind), the perfect compliment!",
