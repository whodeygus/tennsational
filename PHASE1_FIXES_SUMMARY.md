# TENNsational Phase 1 Fixes - Summary

## Overview
This package contains all the Phase 1 functionality fixes for your TENNsational restaurant directory website. All issues you reported have been resolved and tested.

## âœ… Issues Fixed

### 1. Homepage Search Functionality
**Problem**: The "Find Your Perfect Restaurant" search box and "Explore Restaurants" button were non-functional.

- Connected search box to restaurants page with URL parameters
- Search now works with Enter key or button click
- Navigates to `/restaurants?search=query` with the search term
