# 🚀 Complete Deployment Guide for TENNsational

## Overview
This guide will help you replace your current GitHub repository with the new, working version and deploy it through Render to www.tennsational.com.

## 📋 Before You Start

**What You'll Need:**
- Access to your GitHub account
- Access to your Render account
- The files from this folder

**What This Will Do:**
- Replace your broken website with the fully working version
- Keep your custom domain (www.tennsational.com)
- Update your site with all 150 real restaurants

## 🗂️ Step 1: Prepare Your GitHub Repository

### Option A: Complete Repository Replacement (Recommended)
1. **Go to your GitHub repository** for TENNsational
2. **Click on each file/folder** in the repository
3. **Delete everything** (don't worry, we're replacing it with the working version)
4. **Upload all files from this folder** to your empty repository

### Option B: Using Git (If You're Comfortable)
```bash
# Clone your repository
git clone [your-repository-url]
cd [repository-name]

# Remove all existing files
rm -rf *
rm -rf .*  # Remove hidden files too

# Copy new files (replace /path/to/this/folder with actual path)
cp -r /path/to/this/folder/* .
cp -r /path/to/this/folder/.* .

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "Update to working version with 150 restaurants"
git push origin main
```

## ⚙️ Step 2: Configure Render

5. **Save any changes** if needed

## 🚀 Step 3: Deploy

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If Build Fails:

3. **Ensure package.json** is in the root directory

### If Site Shows Old Version:
1. **Clear your browser cache** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Wait 5-10 minutes** for DNS propagation
3. **Check Render deployment status**

### If Restaurants Page is Still Blank:
1. **Verify the build completed successfully**
